### Redux Testing
The guiding principles for testing Redux logic closely follow that of React Testing Library:
<Alert severity="info" icon={<></>}>
The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. - Kent C. Dodds
</Alert>

Our general advice for testing an app using Redux is:
* Prefer writing integration tests with everything working together. 
For a React app using Redux, render a `<Provider>` with a real store instance wrapping the components being tested.
* If needed, use basic unit tests for pure functions such as particularly complex reducers or selectors.
However, in many cases, these are just implementation details that are covered by integration tests instead.
* Do not try to mock selector functions or the React-Redux hooks! 

#### Testing Tools

* Basic testing library: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
* React DOM testing library: [React Testing Library(RTL)](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
* API mocking library: [Mock Service Worker(MSW)](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started)



#### Testing Reducer function

Because most of the Redux code you write are functions, 
and many of them are pure, they are easy to test without mocking. 
Call the reducer with a specific input `state` and `action`, and assert that the result state matches expectations.

**Example**: 

<CustomCode language="ts">{todoSliceSourceCode}</CustomCode>

can be tested like:

<CustomCode language="ts">{todoSliceTestSourceCode}</CustomCode>

#### Testing Redux Thunk
We consider thunk behavior to be an implementation detail of the application, 
and recommend that it be covered by testing the group of components (or whole app) using it, 
rather than testing the thunk in isolation.

#### Redux integration Testing
Our recommendation is to mock async requests at the `fetch/xhr` level using tools like msw,

By mocking requests at this level, 
none of the thunk logic has to change in a test - the thunk still tries to make a "real" async request, 
it just gets intercepted.

**Write an Example App Code** which connected component and redux async logic:
<SyntaxHighlighter schema={[
  { "features/user/userDisplay.tsx": userDisplaySourceCode },
  { "app/store.ts": userStoreSourceCode },
  { "features/user/userSlice.ts": userSliceSourceCode },
]} /> 


it render like:
<Canvas>
{withWorker(withStore(UserDisplay),worker)()}
</Canvas>
This app involves thunks, reducers and selectors. 
All of these can be tested by writing an integration test with the following in mind:
* `idle` status, UI will render `initialState` "No user"
* `loading` status, UI will render "Fetching user..."  
* `complete` status, UI will render the exact `{userName}` which come from api call
* `failure` status, UI will render "Fetching Fail!"

**Setting Up a Reusable Test Render Function**: 

Any Redux-connected components will need a React-Redux `<Provider>` component wrapped around them, 
with a real Redux store set up and provided.

A typical **custom render function** setup could look like this:

<CustomCode language="tsx">{testUtilsSourceCode}</CustomCode> 

With custom render function, 
we able to write integration testing code connecting comopnents and redux logic by resuing `renderWithProviders`: 

<CustomCode language="ts">{userDisplayTestSourceCode}</CustomCode> 

After running the test, we can got 100% coverage for both `user/userSlice` and `user/UserDisplay` files.
