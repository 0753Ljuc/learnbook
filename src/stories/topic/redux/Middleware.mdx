### Side effect

> Redux reducers must never contain "side effects". 
**A "side effect" is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function**.
<br />

Some common kinds of side effects are things like:
<StyledPaper>
 * Logging a value to the console
 * Saving a file
 * Setting an async timer
 * Making an AJAX HTTP request
 * Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
 * Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now())
</ StyledPaper>


<br />

### Middleware 
Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects.
> A `middleware` is a higher-order function that **composes a dispatch function to return a new dispatch function**. It often turns `async actions` into actions.


#### Definition 

```ts
type MiddlewareAPI = { dispatch: Dispatch, getState: () => State };
type Middleware = (api: MiddlewareAPI) => (next: Dispatch) => Dispatch;
```

<br />

### Make A Middleware

So, the middleware signature is `({ getState, dispatch }) => next => action`, Let's try to create a logger middleware: 
```ts
import { Middleware } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

const alerter: Middleware = ({ getState }) => next => action => {
    alert('will dispatch: ' + JSON.stringify(action))

    // Call the next dispatch method in the middleware chain.
    const returnValue = next(action)

    alert('state after dispatch: ' + JSON.stringify(getState()))

    // This will likely be the action itself, unless a middleware further in chain changed it.
    return returnValue
}

export default alerter
``` 


#### usage

> `applyMiddleware` will create a store enhancer that applies middleware to the dispatch method of the Redux store. 

**in legacy redux**:
```ts
const store = createStore(
    reducer,
    preloadedState,
    applyMiddleware(alerter)
)
```

**in redux RTK**:
```ts
const store = configureStore({
    reducer,
    middleware: (getDefailtMiddlewares) => getDefailtMiddlewares().concat(alerter)
})
```

**Render**:
<Provider store={store} >
  <StyledPaper>
    <Counter />
  </ StyledPaper>
</ Provider> 


<br />
<br />

### Source Code

Let's check the source code of `applyMiddleware`: 
```ts
function applyMiddleware(...middlewares) {
  return (createStore2) => (reducer, preloadedState) => {
    const store = createStore2(reducer, preloadedState);

    // prevent dispatch function call while chain not yet create.
    let dispatch = () => {
      throw new Error(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? formatProdErrorMessage(15) : "Dispatching while constructing your middleware is not allowed. Other middleware would not be applied to this dispatch.");
    };
    const middlewareAPI = {
      getState: store.getState,
      dispatch: (action, ...args) => dispatch(action, ...args)
    };
    const chain = middlewares.map((middleware) => middleware(middlewareAPI));
    dispatch = compose(...chain)(store.dispatch);
    return {
      ...store,
      dispatch
    };
  };
}

```

`compose`: 
```ts 
function compose(...middlewares) {
  return arg => middlewares.reduceRight((composed, fn) => fn(composed), arg);
}
```

> The last middleware in the chain will receive the real store's dispatch method as the next parameter, thus ending the chain

So we can understand the final dispatch we got is look like below:

```ts 
dispatch = compose(md1,md2,md3)(store.dispatch);
// equal: 
dispatch = fn1(fn2(fn3(store.dispatch))));
```

<Alert severity="info" icon={<></>}>
Now we don't need to use `applyMiddleware` as RTK already integrated in `configStore`.
</Alert>

<br />
### Thunk
> **Thunk** is a programming term that means "a piece of code that does some delayed work", 
thunks allow us to write additional Redux-related logic separate from a UI layer

#### thunkMiddleware implement

```ts 
const thunkMiddleware =
  ({ dispatch, getState }) =>
  next =>
  action => {
    // If the "action" is actually a function instead...
    if (typeof action === 'function') {
      // then call the function and pass `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments
      return action(dispatch, getState)
    }

    // Otherwise, it's a normal action - send it onwards
    return next(action)
  }
```

#### how to use a thunk function 
A thunk function is a function that accepts two arguments: the Redux store `dispatch` method, and the Redux store `getState` method.
```ts 
const thunkFunction = (dispatch, getState) => {
  // logic here that can dispatch actions or read state
}

store.dispatch(thunkFunction)
```

#### thunk action creator
So base on the thunkFunction boilerplate, 
we can write a `thunk action creator` which is typically closes over any arguments passed to the action creator.
```ts
export const fetchTodoById = (todoId: number) => async (dispatch: AppDispatch) => {
    const res = await fakeFetchTodoById(todoId)
    dispatch(updateTodo(res.todo))
}
```

#### enable thunk in RTK
We can apply thunk middleware in RTK like below:
```ts
const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        todo: todoSlice,
    },
    middleware: (getDefailtMiddlewares) => {
        return getDefailtMiddlewares({
            thunk: true
        })
    },
})
```

#### Store enhancer 
A store enhancer is a higher-order function that `composes` a store creator to return a new enhanced store creator. 
It is similar with middleware, and most likely you'll never write a store enhancer.
```ts 
type StoreEnhancer = (next: StoreCreator) => StoreCreator
```
