<Meta title="Topic/Redux/Redux Toolkit" />


### Redux Toolkit
> Redux Toolkit (also known as "RTK" for short) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. 
The @reduxjs/toolkit package wraps around the core redux package, 
and contains API methods and common dependencies that we think are essential for building a Redux app. 
Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, 
prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

<br />
#### Configure Store
An simple example of defining **store** and exporting two specific types: `state` and `dispatch`.
```tsx
// redux/store.ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import counterSlice from './counter/counterSlice'

const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        counter: counterSlice,
    }
})

// Infer the `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types from the store itself
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>
// Inferred type: {posts: PostsState, comments: CommentsState, users: UsersState}
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch

export default store
```
<br />

Define **typed hook** which can help to infer your state implictly:  
```ts

// redux/hook.ts
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'
import type { RootState, AppDispatch } from './store'

// Use throughout your app instead of plain `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector

```
<br />


#### Create Slice

By defining **slice** with `createSlice`, we don't need to define action anymore as the slice will create `actions` automatically.

```tsx

// redux/counter/counterSlice.ts
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

// Define a type for the slice state
export interface CounterState {
  value: number
}

// Define the initial state using that type
const initialState: CounterState = {
  value: 0
}

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  // `createSlice` will infer the state type from the `initialState` argument
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: state => {
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: state => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    // Use the PayloadAction type to declare the contents of `action.payload`
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    }
  }
})

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions
export default counterSlice.reducer

``` 

Let's see what is the definition of slice:

```ts

export interface Slice<State = any, CaseReducers extends SliceCaseReducers<State> = SliceCaseReducers<State>, Name extends string = string, ReducerPath extends string = Name, Selectors extends SliceSelectors<State> = SliceSelectors<State>> {
    /**
     * The slice name.
     */
    name: Name;
    /**
     *  The slice reducer path.
     */
    reducerPath: ReducerPath;
    /**
     * The slice's reducer.
     */
    reducer: Reducer<State>;
    /**
     * Action creators for the types of actions that are handled by the slice
     * reducer.
     */
    actions: CaseReducerActions<CaseReducers, Name>;
    /**
     * The individual case reducer functions that were passed in the `reducers` parameter.
     * This enables reuse and testing if they were defined inline when calling `createSlice`.
     */
    caseReducers: SliceDefinedCaseReducers<CaseReducers>;
    /**
     * Provides access to the initial state value given to the slice.
     * If a lazy state initializer was provided, it will be called and a fresh value returned.
     */
    getInitialState: () => State;
    /**
     * Get localised slice selectors (expects to be called with *just* the slice's state as the first parameter)
     */
    getSelectors(): Id<SliceDefinedSelectors<State, Selectors, State>>;
    /**
     * Get globalised slice selectors (`selectState` callback is expected to receive first parameter and return slice state)
     */
    getSelectors<RootState>(selectState: (rootState: RootState) => State): Id<SliceDefinedSelectors<State, Selectors, RootState>>;
    /**
     * Selectors that assume the slice's state is `rootState[slice.reducerPath]` (which is usually the case)
     *
     * Equivalent to `slice.getSelectors((state: RootState) => state[slice.reducerPath])`.
     */
    get selectors(): Id<SliceDefinedSelectors<State, Selectors, {
        [K in ReducerPath]: State;
    }>>;
    
``` 

Apparently we can see that the slice has properties `actions` and `reducer` which we going to export, and each action name was combined by slice's name and each reducer's name.

<br />
### An Counter Example
Now let's create a simple counter to utilize this store: 

```tsx
export function Counter() {
    // The `state` arg is correctly typed as `RootState` already
    const count = useAppSelector(state => state.counter.value)
    const dispatch = useAppDispatch()

    return <div>
        <h4>counter: {count}</h4>
        <StyledButton onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+</StyledButton>
        <StyledButton onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-</StyledButton>
    </div>
}
```

**Render:**
<Provider store={store} >
  <StyledPaper>
    <Counter />
    </ StyledPaper>
  <DevToolsSwitch />
</ Provider> 




 
<br />
<br />
<br />


<Accordion disableGutters={true}>
  <AccordionSummary   >
  <Typography sx={{padding:0, margin:0}}>
  **Q**: 
    What's the difference between slice's name `counter` and reducer's `counter`, how if there are different? 
  </Typography>
   
  </AccordionSummary>
  <AccordionDetails>
    **A**: slice's `counter` used for action name, reducer's `counter` used for store.state name.
  </AccordionDetails>
</Accordion>
