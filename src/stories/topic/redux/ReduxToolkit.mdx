### Redux Toolkit
> Redux Toolkit (also known as "RTK" for short) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. 
The @reduxjs/toolkit package wraps around the core redux package, 
and contains API methods and common dependencies that we think are essential for building a Redux app. 
Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, 
prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

#### Configure Store
An simple example of defining **store** and exporting two specific types: `state` and `dispatch`.
<SyntaxHighlighter schema={[{"services/store.ts":storeSourceCode}]} />
<br />

Define **typed hook** which can help to infer your state implictly:  
<SyntaxHighlighter schema={[{"services/hooks.ts":storeHooksSourceCode}]} />
<br />


#### Create Slice

By defining **slice** with `createSlice`, we don't need to define action anymore as the slice will create `actions` automatically.
 <SyntaxHighlighter schema={[{"services/counterSlice.ts":counterSliceSourceCode}]} />

<br />
<br />

<details>
<summary>**check the definition of slice**</summary>
```ts

export interface Slice<State = any, CaseReducers extends SliceCaseReducers<State> = SliceCaseReducers<State>, Name extends string = string, ReducerPath extends string = Name, Selectors extends SliceSelectors<State> = SliceSelectors<State>> {
    /**
     * The slice name.
     */
    name: Name;
    /**
     *  The slice reducer path.
     */
    reducerPath: ReducerPath;
    /**
     * The slice's reducer.
     */
    reducer: Reducer<State>;
    /**
     * Action creators for the types of actions that are handled by the slice
     * reducer.
     */
    actions: CaseReducerActions<CaseReducers, Name>;
    /**
     * The individual case reducer functions that were passed in the `reducers` parameter.
     * This enables reuse and testing if they were defined inline when calling `createSlice`.
     */
    caseReducers: SliceDefinedCaseReducers<CaseReducers>;
    /**
     * Provides access to the initial state value given to the slice.
     * If a lazy state initializer was provided, it will be called and a fresh value returned.
     */
    getInitialState: () => State;
    /**
     * Get localised slice selectors (expects to be called with *just* the slice's state as the first parameter)
     */
    getSelectors(): Id<SliceDefinedSelectors<State, Selectors, State>>;
    /**
     * Get globalised slice selectors (`selectState` callback is expected to receive first parameter and return slice state)
     */
    getSelectors<RootState>(selectState: (rootState: RootState) => State): Id<SliceDefinedSelectors<State, Selectors, RootState>>;
    /**
     * Selectors that assume the slice's state is `rootState[slice.reducerPath]` (which is usually the case)
     *
     * Equivalent to `slice.getSelectors((state: RootState) => state[slice.reducerPath])`.
     */
    get selectors(): Id<SliceDefinedSelectors<State, Selectors, {
        [K in ReducerPath]: State;
    }>>;
}
```
Apparently we can see that the slice has properties `actions` and `reducer` which we going to export, and each action name was combined by slice's name and each reducer's name.

### The Counter Example
Now let's create a simple counter to utilize this store: 

 
 
<SyntaxHighlighter schema={[
  {"features/Counter.tsx" : counterSourceCode},
  {"services/store.ts":storeSourceCode},
  {"services/hooks.ts":storeHooksSourceCode},
  {"services/counterSlice.ts":counterSliceSourceCode}
]} />

**Render:**
<Canvas  sourceState="none">
  {withDevtools(Counter)()}
</ Canvas>

<QABox>
  <QABox.Question> 
    What's the difference between slice's name `counter` and reducer's `counter`, how if there are different?
  </ QABox.Question>
  <QABox.Answer> 
    slice's `counter` used for action name, reducer's `counter` used for store.state name.
  </ QABox.Answer>
</ QABox>
